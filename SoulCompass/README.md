## About The Law of One

The Law of One material consists of 106 conversations, called sessions, between Don Elkins, a professor of physics and UFO investigator, and Ra, speaking through Carla Rueckert. Ra states that it/they are a sixth-density social memory complex that formed on Venus about 2.6 billion years ago.

The Law of One states that there is only one, and that one is the Infinite Creator. All things, all life, all of the creation is part of one original thought.
