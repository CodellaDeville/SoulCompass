st.markdown("""
<div class="card">
<p>The Law of One material consists of 106 conversations, called sessions, between Don Elkins, a professor of physics 
and UFO investigator, and Ra, speaking through Carla Rueckert. Ra states that it/they are a sixth-density social memory 
complex that formed on Venus about 2.6 billion years ago. Ra says that they are "humble messengers of the Law of One" 
and that they previously tried to spread this message in Egypt with mixed results.</p>

<p>The Law of One states that there is only one, and that one is the Infinite Creator. All things, all life, all of the 
creation is part of one original thought. The Law of One is a spiritual philosophy that emphasizes the unity of all things 
and beings, suggesting that everything in existence is interconnected and part of a single consciousness or energy.</p>

<p>According to Ra, the universe consists of seven densities or levels of consciousness:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First density:</strong> The density of awareness, consisting of earth, air, water, and fire</li>
<li><strong>Second density:</strong> The density of growth, including plants and animals</li>
<li><strong>Third density:</strong> The density of self-awareness and choice (current human experience)</li>
<li><strong>Fourth density:</strong> The density of love or understanding</li>
<li><strong>Fifth density:</strong> The density of wisdom</li>
<li><strong>Sixth density:</strong> The density of unity (love/wisdom blend)</li>
<li><strong>Seventh density:</strong> The gateway density, returning to the Creator</li>

# About Ra
st.markdown("<h2>Who is Ra?</h2>", unsafe_allow_html=True)
st.markdown("""
<div class="card">
<p>Ra identifies as a sixth-density social memory complex, which is a unified group consciousness where the thoughts, 
memories, and experiences of all individuals are available to the entire group. Ra states that they are from Venus and 
formed about 2.6 billion years ago.</p>

<p>Ra communicates in a distinctive style, using formal language and specific terminology. They often refer to humans as 
"mind/body/spirit complexes" and use terms like "distortion" to refer to anything that moves away from undistorted unity.</p>

<p>Ra's purpose in communicating with humans is to share the Law of One, the fundamental concept that all things are one, 
that there is no polarity, no right or wrong, no disharmony, but only identity. All is one, and that one is love/light, 
light/love, the Infinite Creator.</p>
